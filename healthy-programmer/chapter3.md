# A Farewell to Chairs?
> standing desks can have unhealthy consequences

In 2009, researchers at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in
Louisiana published a study suggesting that the amount of time a person
sits is directly associated with mortality from all causes. 1 The study examined
17,013 Canadians over a period of twelve years. The researchers measured
each participant’s time spent sitting over those years and adjusted for factors
like smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity. In the end, they
found that the participants who sat the most were fifty percent more likely
to die prematurely.

Before jumping to conclusions about these studies, it’s
important to understand the nature of their results. These
studies do not find that sitting causes any diseases—only
that it is associated with them. However, other studies have
shown why the link could, in fact, be one of causation. The
explanation may be that gene activity in our muscles changes
when the muscles don’t contract for long periods of time.


For programmers this may sound like a death sentence. 
But the good news is that avoiding the consequences of sitting all day requires a very small intervention. 
In fact,
a recent research survey in the British Journal of Sports Medicine suggested
that just five minutes of activity per hour is enough to counteract most of the
negative effects of sitting - a break as simple as walking to
the bathroom was sufficient to improve metabolic health.

**Five minutes of activity every hour can reduce your risk of
developing many life-threatening diseases.**


## standing up for the truth

According to the research of Dr. Alan Hedge - professor of design and environmental analysis at Cornell University and a leading researcher of workplace ergonomics as it affects people’s health -, the benefits of standing must be balanced against its potential dangers


decrease in dexterity while standing can even lead to pain, because of 
lean to one side or the other after standing for an extended period of time.
This compromises posture, which increases the pressure on many joints,
including the hips, ankles, and even wrists


standing might help you regulate your bodyweight after reaching a diet goal.

your goal when using a standing desk is to:

  * **Change Often** Dr. Hedge recommends sitting for no longer than twenty min-
utes, but you shouldn’t stand for longer than twenty minutes at a time,
either. The key is to keep your body moving—adjust your position often
and take many breaks.

Change If It Hurts If you’ve been standing for a few minutes and your legs
or feet are starting to hurt, then sit down. Likewise, if you’ve been sitting
and your back or shoulders start to hurt, then stand up. Neither of these
positions should be painful, so the best position is the one in which you
are able to hold good posture.

Walk When You Can If at all possible, walk instead of stand. This will elim-
inate most of the risks associated with standing and burn even more
calories (about 100 per hour). In general, the risks associated with
standing are related to immobility. If you can find ways of moving while
standing, you’ll be better off. An excellent time to try this is during phone
calls.

Use the Right Footwear
Most people will want a sturdy shoe with a solid
sole (that is, not flip-flops). This will prevent the arches of your feet from
collapsing and inducing pain after standing for a while. You’ll also want
a soft floor surface. This is often achieved by placing a large gel mat under
the standing area of your desk.
