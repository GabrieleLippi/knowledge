# Extreme Programming: A gentle introduction

The first Extreme Programming project was started March 6, 1996.

Extreme Programming is successful because it stresses customer satisfaction. Instead of delivering everything you could possibly want on some date far in the future this process delivers the software you need as you need it.

Extreme Programming emphasizes teamwork.

Extreme Programming improves a software project in five essential ways:
  * communication
  * simplicity
  * feedback
  * respect
  * courage

## XP values:

### Simplicity:
We will do what is needed and asked for, but no more.
We will take small simple steps to our goal and mitigate failures as they happen.

### Communication:
Everyone is part of the team and **we communicate face to face daily**.
We will **work together** on everything from requirements to code.


### Feedback:
We will take **every iteration** commitment seriously by delivering **working software**.
We **demonstrate our software early** and often then **listen carefully** and make any changes needed.
We will talk about the project and adapt our process to it, not the other way around.

### Respect:
Everyone gives and feels the respect they deserve as a valued team member.
**Everyone contributes value even if it's simply enthusiasm**.
Developers respect the expertise of the customers and vice versa.
Management respects our right to accept responsibility and receive authority over our own work.

## Courage:
We will tell the truth about progress and estimates.
We don't document excuses for failure because we plan to succeed.
**We don't fear anything because no one ever works alone**.
We will adapt to changes when ever they happen.

## Pair Programming:
>All code to be sent into production is created by two people working together at a single computer.

Pair programming is a social skill that takes time to learn. You are striving for a cooperative way to work that includes give and take from both partners regardless of corporate status.

**One thing pair programming is not is mentoring**. A teacher-stundent relationship feels very different from two people working together as equals even if one has significantly more experience.
