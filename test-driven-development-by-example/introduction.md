# Introduction
You absolutely can place your projects in a position for you to work magic, even if you are
a software engineer with ordinary skills and you sometimes buckle under and take shortcuts
when the pressure builds. **Test-driven development is a set of techniques that any software engineer can follow, which encourages simple designs and test suites that inspire confidence**.
If you are a genius, you don't need these rules. If you are a dolt, the rules won't help. For the
vast majority of us in between, following these two simple rules can lead us to work much
more closely to our potential:

 * **Write a failing automated test before you write any code**.
 * **Remove duplication**.
