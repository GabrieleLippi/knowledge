# Values, Principles, and Practices
> No book of gardening, however complete, makes you a gardener. First you have to garden, then join the community of gardeners, then teach others to garden. Then you are a gardener. So it is with XP

* Practices are the things you do day-to-day.
Specifying practices is useful because they are clear and objective, furthermore they are useful because they give you a place to start.
**You can start writing tests before changing code, and gain benefit from doing so, long before you understand software development in a deeper way**.

* Values are the roots of the things we like and don't like in a situation.

* Principles are domain-specific guidelines for life.

**Practices are evidence of values** and principles are the bridge between the two.

Reading a book won't make anyone an extreme programmer. That only comes with **programming** in the extreme style, **participating** in the community of people who share these values and at least some of your practices, and then **sharing** what you know with others.
