# What is XP?
> Extreme Programming (XP) is about social change.

It's about **finding our adult place in the larger world**, and **writing great code** that is **good for business**.
We need both **technique** and **good relationships** to be succesful. XP addresses both.
**Prepare for success**.
Don't hold back: do your best and then **deal with the consequences**. That's extreme.

## Reconcile humanity and productivity in the practice of software development:

> the more **humanely** we treat ourself and others, the more productive we'll all become

If how I feel is based on an accurate read on whether I did my best, I can feel good about myself by doing my best

**communicate clearly**

**loneliness** is often at the heart of job **dissatisfaction**

# XP assumptions:

 * you see yourself as **part of a team**, ideally one with clear goals and a plan of execution
 * you want to **work together**
 * you want to grow, to **improve your skills**, and to **improve your relationships**
 * you are **willing to make changes** to meet those goals
 * change can be made inexpensive using this method

Given that assumptions, we can answer the question:

# what is XP?

 * XP is **giving up** old, **ineffective technical and social habits** in favor of new ones that work
 * XP is fully appreciating yourself for **total effort** today
 * XP is striving to do **better** tomorrow
 * XP is evaluating yourself by your **contribution** to the team's shared goals
 * XP is asking to get some of **your human needs met through software development**
