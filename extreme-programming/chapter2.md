# Learning to drive
> Driving is not about getting the car going in the right direction. Driving is about constantly paying attention, making a little correction this way, a little correction that way.

## XP Paradimg:
> **stay aware**, **adapt**, **change**

Everything in software changes. The requirements change. The design changes. The business changes. The technology changes. The team changes. The team members change. **The problem isn't change**, because change is going to happen; the problem, **rather, is our inability to cope with change**.

There are two levels at which the driving metaphor applies to XP:
 * customers drive the content of the system.
 * the whole team drives the development process.

 XP lets you adapt by making frequent, small corrections; you don't wait a long time to find out if you were going the wrong way.

 ** The customers don't usually know exactly what the software should do. That's why software development is like driving, not like getting the car pointed straight down the road**
