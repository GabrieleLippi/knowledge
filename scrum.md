# Scrum
>Scrum is a framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products.

## Definition of Scrum

Scrum is a process framework that has been used to manage work on complex products since the early 1990s.
it is a framework within which you can employ various processes and techniques.

The **Scrum framework** consists of **Scrum Teams** and their associated **roles**, **events**, **artifacts**, and **rules**.
**Each component** within the framework serves a specific purpose and is **essential to Scrum’s** success and usage.


## Scrum Theory

Scrum is founded on empiricism.
Three pillars uphold every implementation of empirical process control:
  * **transparency**
        Significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome.
        Transparency requires those aspects be defined by a common standard so observers share a **common understanding** of what is being seen.
  * **inspection**
        Scrum users must frequently inspect Scrum artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal to detect undesirable variances.
  * **adaptation**
        If an inspector determines that one or more aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits, and that the resulting product will be unacceptable, the process or the material being processed must be adjusted.

Scrum prescribes four formal events for inspection and adaptation:

    * Sprint Planning
    * Daily Scrum
    * Sprint Review
    * Sprint Retrospective


## Scrum Values

  * commitment
  * courage
  * focus
  * openness
  * respect

The Scrum Team members learn and explore those values as they work with the Scrum **events**, **roles** and **artifacts**.


## The Scrum Team

The Scrum Team consists of:
  * **Product Owner**
  * **Development Team**
  * **Scrum Master**

Scrum Teams are **self-organizing** and **cross-functional**.
**Self-organizing teams choose how best to accomplish their work**, rather than being directed by others outside the team.
**Cross-functional teams have all competencies needed to accomplish the work** without depending on others not part of the team.

**Scrum Teams deliver products iteratively and incrementally** so that a potentially useful version of working product is always available

## Scrum Artifacts

Scrum’s artifacts represent work or value to provide transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaptation. Artifacts defined by Scrum are specifically designed to maximize transparency of key information so that everybody has the same understanding of the artifact.


## Definition of "Done"

When a Product Backlog item or an Increment is described as "Done", **everyone must understand what "Done" means**.
Although this may vary significantly per Scrum Team, members must have a shared understanding of what it means for work to be complete, to ensure transparency.

The same definition guides the Development Team in knowing how many Product Backlog items it can select during a Sprint Planning. 
The purpose of each Sprint is to deliver Increments of potentially releasable functionality that adhere to the Scrum Team’s current definition of "Done".

Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly tested, ensuring that all Increments work together.

As Scrum Teams mature, it is expected that their definitions of "Done" will expand to include more stringent criteria for higher quality. New definitions, as used, may uncover work to be done in previously "Done" increments. Any one product or system should have a definition of "Done" that is a standard for any work done on it.
