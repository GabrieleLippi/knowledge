This is a book about **humble concerns** whose value is nonetheless far from small.

The late-1990s notions of design driven *only* by the tests and the code are long gone.

1. it is through practice in the small that professionals gain proficiency and trust for practice in the large.
2. the smallest bit of sloppy construction on the floor, or even the mesy desk, completely dispels the charm of the larger whole.

## Maintenance, or the act of repair
In software, 80% or more of what we do is quaintly called "maintenance": the act of repair.
Good software practice requires: focus, presence of mind and thinking. Following the *Total Productive Maintenance* approach, developed around 1951 on the Japanese scene, we can enumerate the **5S principles** for quality:
  1. *Seiri*, or organization. Knowing where things are.
  2. *Seiton*, or tidiness. A piece of code should be where you expect to find it.
  3. *Seiso*, or cleaning. Keep the workplace free of hanging wires.
  4. *Seiketsu*, or standardization. The group agrees about how to keep the workplace clean.
  5. *Shutsuke*, or discipline(*self*-discipline). This means having the discipline to follow the practices and to frequently reflect on one's work and be willing to change

  These are the roots of **responsible professionalims**.

  Quality is the result of a million selfless acts of care - not just of any great method descends from heavens. That these acts are simple doesn't mean that they are simplistic, and it hardly means that they are easy. They are nonetheless the fabric of greatness and, more so, of beauty, in any human endeavor.
  We should keep in mind that design is a process, not a static endpoint.
